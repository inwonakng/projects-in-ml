For example, if the coolant is too hot `{...state, coolanttemp: 99}`, the state transition after the action of cooling it down could be into `{...state, coolanttemp: 50}`. Each sensor or group of sensors should have some action linked to it, in the example it is the case of the 'coolant temp sensor' and 'cooling system'.\n",

This project focuses on reinforcement learning on data from critically ill patients, and learns to predict a \"dead-end\", which means the patient will go in critical condition. In essence, the purpose of this model is to identify which procedures must be taken to **prevent** such dead ends. \n",

    "The problem is modeled such that a positive outcome gets a reward of 1, and a negative outcome gets a reward of -1. The state space is compoesd of various features of a patient, such as their blodd pressure or hear rate. They also make use of a specific variety of reinforcement learning, called offline reinforcement learning where the learning happens with existing data. Usually, this approach can still take a large amount of data to train sufficiently, but by scoping the problem to a specific domain, the authors show that their model does indeed work. \n",
